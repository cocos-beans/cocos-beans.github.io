      Hello. Unfortunately due to the fact that I am lazy and prioritize the
      look of my website over functionality, you cannot view this website on a
      mobile browser (yet)! 🙅‍♀️<br />
      Soon this may change but for now it isn't going to. If you would like to
      see the website you can log onto your PC and check it out there.<br />
      Made a mistake?
